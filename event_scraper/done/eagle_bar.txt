I need a webscraper python script.
The python script is required to acquire all upcoming/future events from https://sf-eagle.com/events/.

Return a JSON array of event objects. Each object must have these fields:
- "title": string (event name)
- "description": string or null
- "location": string or null
- "start_datetime": string in ISO 8601 format (e.g. "2025-03-15T19:00:00") or null
- "end_datetime": string in ISO 8601 format or null
- "url": string or null (event-specific URL if available)

Rules:
- Only include events that appear to be upcoming or future events.
- If a field is unknown, set it to null.
- If no events are found, return an empty array [].
- Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.

After the scraper is made the scraper should be included in event_manager.py in the same way the other
scrapers are.
